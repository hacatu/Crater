Basic line, word, and byte counting utility
Written by hacatu

Usage:
	`wc [<options>] <files>`: print counts for each file and total count.
	`wc [<options>] --files0-from=<file> [<files>]`: read list of null terminated filenames from <file>, and optionally additional files.
Counts are printed in the order: lines, words, characters, bytes, maximum line length.
If no count options are given, line, word, and byte counts are printed.
If no files are given, standard input is read instead.  To read standard input as well as other files, "-" can be given as a filename.

	-h/--help: display this help information and exit
	-l/--lines: 	print line counts, where lines are separated by utf8 line separators, namely u000A, u000B, u000C, u000D, u000D followed by u000A, u0085, u2028, or u2029
	-w/--words: 	print word counts, where a word is defined as a maximal run of non-whitespace characters, as determined by iswspace
	-m/--chars: 	print character counts, counting multibyte utf8 characters, invalid utf8 bytes, and embedded null bytes as one character each
	-c/--bytes: 	print byte counts
	-L/--max-line-length: 	print length of longest line in bytes
	-f/--files0-from: 	read list of null terminated filenames from the given argument, or stdin if "-" is given
	-v/--version: 	print version and exit
